Internship Task 6 â€“ Subqueries and Nested Queries
This is my submission for Internship Task 6. In this task, I used subqueries and nested logic to perform advanced filtering and analysis on a single product table using SQL.

*What I Did

Created one table:

e_commerce_task_6 â€“ Stores product details such as name, category, price, and quantity.
Inserted 10 sample product records.
Practiced the following subquery concepts:
Scalar subqueries â€“ comparing with a single value
Correlated subqueries â€“ referencing outer query values
IN, EXISTS, and = in subqueries
Used aggregate functions (AVG, MIN, MAX, COUNT)
Applied GROUP BY and HAVING clauses to group and filter results.

SQL Concepts Practiced
Subqueries in WHERE clause
Correlated subqueries
Aggregate functions inside subqueries
Category-based comparisons
Filtering groups using HAVING

*Tools Used
MySQL
SQL Editor: MySQL Workbench / DB Browser for SQLite
CHATGPT for Questions
Database: internship_task

ðŸ“© Message to HR / Reviewer
In this task, I learned how to apply subqueries and nested logic to analyze and filter data more effectively. This helped me understand how to use inner queries with comparison operators and grouping to solve real-time data problems in SQL.

The complete SQL code is attached with this submission.

Thank you!
